# RoadAccidentsInIndia
A data analysis project to explore and visualise road accidents in the various states of India.
Datasets retrieved from data.gov.in
These datasets through light upon the varied accidents taking place in the country due to numerous reasons.
Worked in a group of 2 to do an analytical case study on these data sets to get statistically sound inferences.
Normalised the dataset, did an analytical study by plotting graphs to get statistically sound inferences and give recommendations to reduce accidents.
The code was mainly hard coded since I was trying to explore how to use python to fetch and plot data.
